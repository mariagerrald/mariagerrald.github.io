I am a junior developer with focus and training in GIS, Microsoft .Net framework and Javascript.   I moved to Sweden from the United States in late 2013.   While learning Swedish, I have had the opportunity to study GIS and programming through formal coursework as well as independent learning.  I enjoy solving coding problems and learning new technologies.  Years ago while completing my Bachelors of Science in Biology, I had enjoyed taking courses in programming and math.  I have also always liked maps and geospatial information.   It is rewarding to be able to combine these two interests and return to study and work in these areas again.    

# Projects including web projects, maps and writing

- <a href="https://skyddsvarda-trad-jkpg.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Skyddsvärda träd</a>  
<!--(provide link to site and to github code)  -->
Searchable interactive map app displaying protection worthy old trees in Jönköpings Län.  Website created with Leaflet mapping library and  Javascript/jQuery.  Retrieves tree data through Rest API queries to Lanstyrelsens ArcGIS WMS server.
<!--- <a href="https://skyddsvarda-trad-jkpg.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Need to add github link to WebApi for Big Trees</a>  
Fullstack version of the protected tree app. To create this solution, I exported the protected trees shapefile data into a SQL database with the utility ogr2ogr.   Then built the API with Asp.Net WebApi2.  Project is not live online - but code viewable at github repo link above. -->
<!--hosts the data in a sql database and u WebApi with Asp.net to serve data the protected tree data from a sql database-->
- <a href="http://three-selection.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Chickens Change in Sweden 2005-2016</a>  
Simple web map using statistics from Statistics Sweden (SCB) to visualize regional changes in number of chickens between 2005-2016.  I used <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ " target="_blank">Qgis</a> to join the region shapefile with the chicken data and then export the data to GeoJson.   Website is a modified version of Leaflets choropleth map tutorial.
- <a href="https://skyddsvarda-trad-jkpg.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Need to add github link to Community Forum </a>   
Forum website including an events/news page, private messaging, and moderator/admin roles.  Built with Asp.Net MVC, AngularJS, SQL database.  Not hosted live currently, but code viewable on Github at link above.

- [Map - Cities in Countries with Population over 10 Million ]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/CitiesCountiesOver10Million.PNG) - map created with ArcGIS 
- [Map - Potential Dumpsite Areas Larger than 5 Hectares]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/PotentialDumpsiteAreasLargerThan5Hectares.PNG)  
Example of creating a map using buffer criteria around features in ArcGIS.  (Map is a low quality copy of an image unfortunately)
- [Writing Excerpt - Implementation of GIS in EIA]({% post_url 2014-11-15-GIS-EIA %})  
Excerpt from a paper written for GIS A21 (Lund Univ).  Paper discusses challenges in spatial data discovery and management in context of Environmental Assessments.  How EU Inspire is relevant.     

# Internship

Cube Corner AB - Huskvarna jun 2016- dec 2016  
-  Worked on improving web platform for shipment handling.  Contributed changes to both the front end in javascript and jQuery as well as the back end coding in C# and PostgreSQL stored procedures.   
- Other projects include programming in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to export data to excel tables from Jeeves enterprise system (affärssystem).  Writing SQL stored procedures to export data to reports designed with Crystal Reports.  
  
<!--As part of the Asp.Net course, I did an internship in 2016 with a consult company Cube Corner in Huskvarna.  My contributions during internship included:   
-  Work on improving their web platform for shipment handling.  I contributed changes to both the front end in javascript and jQuery as well as the back end coding in C# and PostgreSQL stored procedures.   
- Programming in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to export data and create excel tables from Jeeves enterprise system
- Writing SQL stored procedures to export data for and then design Crystal Reports.  
  
Cube Corner wanted me to continue as permanent employee in a consultant role.  I decided however, that I didn't feel ready for a consultant role yet as I wanted to continue to improve my programming and swedish skills in a more back-office role.  -->
