I am a junior developer with focus and training in GIS and Microsoft.Net.   I moved to Sweden from the United States in late 2013.   While learning Swedish, I have had the oppurtunity to study GIS and programming.  Several years ago while completing my Bachelors of Science in Biology, I had taken several courses in programming and math.  It has been extremely rewarding to study and work in these areas again.   I enjoy solving coding problems, debugging programs and the reward of getting code working well.  I also have always loved maps and geospatial information.   It is great to be able to combine these two interests.

# Praktik

As part of my Asp.Net utbildning, I was placed in a praktik with a consult företag Cube Corner in Huskvarna.   I worked internally on improving a webb platform written in javascript, jquery and with a postgresql database backend.   Other projects included programming in VBA excel to connecting to äffarsystem database and creating Crystal Reports

Cube Corner was very satisfied with my work and wanted me to continue as permanent employee as a consultant.  I decided however, that I didn't feel ready for a consultant role yet as I wanted to continue to improve my swedish and programming skills.
